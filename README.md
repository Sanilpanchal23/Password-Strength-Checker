1. Download the `project-aether.html` file
2. Open it directly in your web browser
3. No installation or server required!

### Usage

1. **Enter a password** in the input field to analyze its strength in real-time
2. **View the circular meter** that visually represents password strength with color coding
3. **Check the statistics** for estimated crack time, information entropy, and breach history
4. **Read the actionable feedback** for specific improvement suggestions
5. **Generate strong passwords** with the built-in generator (16 characters by default)
6. **Toggle dark/light mode** using the beautiful switch in the header
7. **Save passwords** to history for future reference (stored locally)
8. **Export results** or share via encrypted links

## üìÅ File Structure

The entire application is contained in a single HTML file with three main sections:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Meta tags, title, and external resources -->
    <style>
      /* All CSS styles - over 500 lines of carefully crafted design */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Application HTML structure -->
    <script>
      // All JavaScript functionality - over 400 lines of code
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## üé® Design Features

### Visual Design
- Modern glass-morphism design with subtle gradients
- Smooth animations and transitions throughout
- Circular progress meter with dynamic color changes
- Responsive grid layout that adapts to all screen sizes
- Professional color scheme with semantic colors (success, warning, error)

### User Experience
- Real-time feedback as you type
- Interactive elements with hover states and visual feedback
- Copy to clipboard with confirmation notification
- Password visibility toggle
- Tooltips for additional information
- History management with useful actions

## üîß Customization

The application is designed to be easily customizable through CSS variables:

### Theming
Modify the CSS variables at the top of the style section:

```css
:root {
  --accent-color: #6366f1;      /* Primary brand color */
  --success-color: #10b981;     /* Success indicators */
  --warning-color: #f59e0b;     /* Warning indicators */
  --danger-color: #ef4444;      /* Error indicators */
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Password Requirements
Adjust password strength criteria in the JavaScript section:

```javascript
// In calculateScore function
if (password.length >= 12) {    // Change minimum length requirement
  // Award points
}
```

## üåê API Integration

Project Aether uses the [Have I Been Pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) to check passwords against known data breaches. The implementation:

- Only transmits the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash
- Never sends the full password or complete hash
- Preserves user privacy while providing security insights

## üìù License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the license section in the code for details.

## ü§ù Contributing

While this is a single-file application, suggestions and improvements are welcome:

1. Create a copy of the HTML file
2. Make your enhancements
3. Test thoroughly across browsers
4. Share your improvements

## üêõ Known Issues

- Breach checking requires internet connection and may fail if the HIBP API is unavailable
- Password history is stored in plain text in localStorage (though masked in UI)
- Very long passwords (1000+ characters) may cause performance issues

## üîÆ Future Enhancement Ideas

- [ ] Add password strength comparison tool
- [ ] Implement two-factor authentication integration guide
- [ ] Add password expiration reminders
- [ ] Create browser extension version
- [ ] Add multi-language support
- [ ] Implement advanced password policies customization
- [ ] Add password health scoring system

## üìä Version History

- **2.0** (Current) - Complete redesign with dark/light mode, password history, and enhanced UI
- **1.0** - Initial release with basic functionality

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development Notes

This application demonstrates several advanced web development techniques:

1. **CSS Variables** for theming and consistency
2. **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for responsive layouts
3. **ES6+ JavaScript** features including async/await
4. **Web Components** methodology in a single file
5. **Local Storage API** for data persistence
6. **Modern CSS** features like gradients, transitions, and filters

## üöÄ Performance Tips

1. The application is optimized for performance with efficient algorithms
2. Debouncing could be added for extremely rapid input handling
3. For production use, consider splitting into separate files for caching benefits
